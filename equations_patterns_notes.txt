equation pattern color reflect a lorenz attractor made with [winter] colormap

changes made on sigma for "equation dx/dt" has direct influence to the [dark blue] pattern
changes made on rho for "equation dy/dt" has direct influence to the [lighter green] pattern
changes made on beta for "equation dz/dt" has direct influence to the [darker green] pattern
